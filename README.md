# :tada: Stacks

Stacks is a initiave to have differents **kinds** of runtimes for different types of projects. 

This is a meta repo, with some code also. 

The idea is based on the experience of having used [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) with cloudfoundry. 

For example this repo starts with datascience. It has `jupyter lab`, `pandas` and other tools.

Some images could be used entirely doing `docker run <image_name>` or as a base for a newer image. 

When possible services run with the non-root user `app`, so if you want to add packages you will need to create a `Dockerfile` use the
`root` user and install theese packages. 

If some package is founded to be a very common dependency, for instance in datascience stack I added vim because is a runtime for development purpose, reach me out and I can 
add new packages to the image it self. 


## Whatn this repository? 

First stacks in their subfolders:

- dataenv
Is a docker-compose with common databases and kv sotres like redis.
Also it provides managment tools like adminer or pgadmin

- datascience 
A curated python docker environment to work with data. This image is built without conda. 

- flask_template
A quick starter for flask + sqlalchemy

And also I keep a main docker-compose with a common environment. 
And a script for SSL certificates generation (only for dev). 

## Caution

None of this was intended or is recommended for production use. 


## Scaffolding

[Folders are namespaces](https://blog.golang.org/package-names). 

Each subfolder from here will have their own dependency managment. Mostly Python, Go and Javascript.

Each project could have their own structure, because sometimes I could use the subfolder as a kickstarter project. 
Usually they follow a pattern:

- a Makefile with some semantics `install`, `build`, `docker` and `release`
- linting specific tools
- ignore files
- `data`, `notebooks` folfers. 
- Some libraries configurations like `alembic` for sqlalchemy in the python world. 

### Ignore files

Some projects could be private, so please pay attention on the `.gitignore` file in the root of this project. 

Usually each environment starts with a `.gitignore` built using the [topal tool](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore) but custom files and folder could be added.

Also I try to add a broad of differents IDEs in the mix. Feel free to add whatever IDE that you considerer. 

## About this repo

This is a meta repo, a galaxy (?) to find differents stacks.

## Changelog

### 2021-10-29
- Fileserver repo added

### 2021-08-17
- I'm adding a new use case for stacks. 
Usually I work having a `docker-compose.yml` file by project. With the proliferation of differents services with common dependencies this approach starts to break a little bit the principle of DRY. So as developer I want to have only one place to start a developent environment for any project.
